# ADR Format

ADRs live in the repo's ADR directory (usually `docs/adr/`) and use sequential four-digit numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc. — see **Numbering** below for which directory and which number.

Create the ADR directory lazily — only when the first ADR is needed.

## Template

````md
# {Short title of the decision}

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q{the question} -->|chosen| A["what we decided"]
    Q -->|rejected| B["the alternative, and why not"]
```

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
````

Every ADR opens with one small Mermaid decision diagram (see
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/diagram-convention.md`, Rule 3). Add one
`|rejected|` branch per alternative considered.

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why* — not in filling out sections.

## Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs won't need them.

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`) — useful when decisions are revisited
- **Considered Options** — only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering
- **Consequences** — only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out

## Numbering

Next number = **global max + 1**, where the max spans every ref, every worktree and
every uncommitted file — not just your checkout. Two sessions that each scan only
their own tree mint the same number, and git merges both files without conflict
because the numbers collide but the filenames don't.

Pick the ADR directory first — put the ADR where the existing ADRs on this topic
live. Each directory is its own sequence, so cite across sequences as
`<owner> ADR NNNN`, never bare. Then set that directory's **repo-root-relative**
path and run this; it prints the number to use.

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && d=docs/adr
m=$( { git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads refs/remotes refs/stash |
         while IFS= read -r r; do git ls-tree -r --name-only --full-tree "$r" -- "$d"; done
       git ls-files -- "$d"
       git worktree list --porcelain | sed -n 's|^worktree ||p' |
         while IFS= read -r p; do ls "$p/$d" 2>/dev/null; done
     } | sed 's|.*/||' | grep -oE '^[0-9]{4}' | sort -n | tail -1 )
printf 'next: %04d\n' $((10#${m:-0} + 1))
```

```powershell
Set-Location (git rev-parse --show-toplevel); $d = 'docs/adr'; $n = @()
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads refs/remotes refs/stash |
  ForEach-Object { $n += git ls-tree -r --name-only --full-tree $_ -- $d }
$n += git ls-files -- $d
git worktree list --porcelain | Where-Object { $_ -like 'worktree *' } |
  ForEach-Object { $p = Join-Path $_.Substring(9) $d
                   if (Test-Path $p) { $n += Get-ChildItem $p -Name } }
$m = ($n | ForEach-Object { if ($_ -match '(^|/)(\d{4})') { [int]$Matches[2] } } |
      Measure-Object -Maximum).Maximum
'next: {0:d4}' -f ([int]$m + 1)
```

Four ways a hand-rolled version returns a wrong number *silently*: dropping
`--full-tree` (the pathspec then resolves against your cwd, so from a subdirectory
you scan a different sequence at exit 0); word-splitting a worktree path (repo paths
contain spaces — take everything after the literal `worktree ` prefix, and ignore the
HEAD/branch/locked/prunable lines); globbing `**/docs/adr` (folds every sequence and
every nested worktree into one max); and incrementing a zero-padded number directly
(`$((0012+1))` is read as octal and yields 11, `$((0059+1))` errors) instead of
stripping the zeros and re-padding to four digits.

Empty output from any one source is normal — a branch may predate the directory, a
worktree may not contain it, a stale worktree path is a skip. Only a non-zero exit
from git is a failure; outside a git repo, fall back to listing that one directory
and say that you did, because the number is then only as good as your checkout.
**Mint from the max, never from a gap** — a renumber leaves permanent holes and older
commits still cite the retired number, so filling a hole re-creates the collision.
**Re-run this immediately before you merge or push** — that is when a parallel
session's number first becomes visible, and the merge will not flag the clash.

Repo-specific routing (which directory new ADRs go in, whether older per-plugin
sequences are closed) belongs in that repo's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md, not here.

## When to offer an ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will look at the code and wonder "why on earth did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it — you'll just reverse it. If it's not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there's nothing to record beyond "we did the obvious thing."

### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the read model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target. Not every library — just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; other contexts reference it by ID only." The explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We're using manual SQL instead of an ORM because X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite. These stop the next engineer from "fixing" something that was deliberate.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "We can't use AWS because of compliance requirements." "Response times must be under 200ms because of the partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If you considered GraphQL and picked REST for subtle reasons, record it — otherwise someone will suggest GraphQL again in six months.
