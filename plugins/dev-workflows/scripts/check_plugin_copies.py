"""check_plugin_copies.py - find every copy of a plugin or skill, and grade it.

Reports where a plugin or bare skill exists on THIS machine and whether each
copy matches the source. It CHANGES NOTHING: a person reads the report and
makes the repair it names (ADR 0104).

Only `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is hashed (ADR 0109). A copy whose
`references/` or `scripts/` drifted therefore grades IN SYNC, and the report
says so on its summary line rather than letting a clean answer stand for more
than it measured.

Nothing about any particular machine is hard-coded. Every location is derived
at run time from the marketplace registry, so the same code runs unchanged on
a machine it has never seen (ADR 0108).

Usage:
  python check_plugin_copies.py --plugin NAME [--marketplace NAME] [--strict]
  python check_plugin_copies.py --plugin NAME --root PATH [--root PATH ...]

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings under --strict, 2 cannot run.
